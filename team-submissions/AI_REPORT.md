## AI-Assisted Workflow and Verification

### 1. Workflow

We primarily used **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** as AI assistants during the development process.  
Their main roles were to generate example code, help supplement prerequisite knowledge, and assist in drafting descriptive text when needed.

Our team did not directly rely on AI-generated outputs as final results. Instead, we were responsible for modifying the generated content, organizing all components into a coherent structure, and carefully reviewing the logic and consistency of the overall implementation. All architectural decisions and final integrations were handled manually to ensure correctness.

This workflow allowed us to leverage AI for efficiency while maintaining full human control over the system design and logical validity.

### 2. Verification Strategy

We validated the AI-generated code by running and testing it locally using VS Code. The code was executed in the intended development environment, where we checked for syntax errors, runtime errors. We also verified that the outputs matched expected results and iteratively fixed any issues identified during execution. This hands-on testing ensured the generated code was functional and reliable.
